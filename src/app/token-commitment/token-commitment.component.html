                <strong>Our commitment is dedicated to the following core principles:</strong>
            </p>
            <div class="principles-grid">
                <!-- Principle 1: Community Governance -->
                <div class="principle">
                    <div class="principle-icon">
                        <i class="fas fa-gavel"></i>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Community Governance</h3>
                    <p>
                        REAL iREAL is built on decentralized governance. As a member of our DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), you play an active role in guiding the project’s direction. With every vote, you shape the future of REAL, ensuring that decisions reflect
                        the values and goals of the entire community.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <!-- Principle 2: Transparency -->
                <div class="principle">
                    <div class="principle-icon">
                        <i class="fas fa-eye"></i>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Transparency</h3>
                    <p>
                        Transparency is at the heart of everything we do. From token distribution to governance decisions, REAL is committed to providing clear, accessible information. Your engagement in REAL comes with complete visibility into our processes, from platform updates
                        to token burning events.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <!-- Principle 3: Deflationary Tokenomics -->
                <div class="principle">
                    <div class="principle-icon">
                        <i class="fas fa-fire"></i>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Deflationary Tokenomics</h3>
                    <p>
                        REAL’s deflationary tokenomics model supports a sustainable and exclusive ecosystem. With each burn event, the total supply decreases, creating a unique environment of scarcity. Our approach encourages long-term holding and community participation, strengthening
                        REAL’s ecosystem over time.
                    </p>

                        <i class="fas fa-lock"></i>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Security on Ethereum</h3>
                    <p>
                        We prioritize security by leveraging the Ethereum blockchain, known for its reliability and secure infrastructure. REAL’s platform adheres to industry-leading practices to safeguard all interactions on the platform, ensuring a secure environment for members
                        and peace of mind for all REAL token holders.
                    </p>
                </div>
