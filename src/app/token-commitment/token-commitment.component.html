          <h3>Transparency</h3>
          <p>

            decisions, REAL is committed to providing clear, accessible information. Your engagement in

          <h3>Deflationary Tokenomics</h3>
          <p>
            REAL’s deflationary tokenomics model supports a sustainable and exclusive ecosystem. With
            each burn event, the total supply decreases, creating a unique environment of scarcity. Our
            approach encourages long-term holding and community participation, strengthening REAL’s
            ecosystem over time.
