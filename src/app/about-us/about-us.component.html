        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p class="about-text mb-5">
          Welcome to REAL—the Real Estate Alliance League—a community-driven real estate DAO that redefines access to property holdings.
          Built on the Ethereum blockchain, REAL empowers individuals to actively participate in a transparent, secure, and decentralized ecosystem, blending blockchain innovation with real-world real estate opportunities.
          Our members aren’t just token holders; they’re a core part of our decision-making community. With REAL tokens, holders can influence and interact with the project’s growth, benefiting from both a tokenized economy and tangible real estate property opportunities.

          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            REAL’s mission is to make real estate investment accessible, rewarding, and community-focused. By using the Ethereum blockchain’s security and transparency, we provide a platform that builds passive income through rental properties.
          </p>
          <p>
            The income from rental properties fuels our deflationary model, enhancing token value by reducing supply through “Token Burns.” This process creates a long-term, member-driven approach to value within a fixed supply of 100 million tokens.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our members shape REAL’s future through a DAO structure, ensuring that each voice within the community is heard.
