            Welcome to REAL—the Real Estate Alliance League—a community-driven real estate DAO that
            redefines access to property holdings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Built on the Ethereum blockchain, REAL empowers individuals to actively participate in a
            transparent, secure, and decentralized ecosystem, blending blockchain innovation with
            real-world real estate opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our members aren’t just token holders; they’re a core part of our decision-making community.
            With REAL tokens, holders can influence and interact with the project’s growth, benefiting from
            both a tokenized economy and tangible real estate property opportunities.

          <p>The income from rental properties fuels our deflationary model, which enhances token value by

          <h5>Transparent & Decentralized</h5>
          <p>
            REAL is built on the Ethereum blockchain, leveraging its
            security and transparent framework to deliver a community-driven investment experience.
          </p>
          <h5>Cost-Free Membership</h5>
          <p>
            REAL has no membership fees—just hold REAL tokens to access all
            platform features, with membership benefits increasing alongside token holdings.
          </p>
          <h5>Deflationary Token Model</h5>
          <p>
            With a capped supply and regular token burns, REAL’s
            deflationary model sustains long-term value and aligns with the growth of the real estate
            portfolio.
          </p>
          <h5>Active Governance</h5>
          <p>
            The DAO gives members direct involvement, from voting on platform
            upgrades to deciding on token disbursement and even leadership choices, making REAL a truly
            collaborative project.

            them to track the real-world properties generating revenue for the platform. This level of
            transparency builds trust and provides insight into property performance.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card card2">

            REAL token holders can participate in voting on key aspects of the platform. Members have a say in:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Token market disbursement and adjustments </li>
            <li> Platform upgrades, improvements, and new features </li>

            REAL’s platform fosters an active and interactive community.
            Members have access to a community chat built to engage in real-time discussions with other
            members, share insights, and stay informed about platform updates.

          <h3>Document and Template Access</h3>
          <p>
            The platform provides members with a library of document
            templates, making it easier for users to submit property information, propose ideas, and stay
            organized. This feature simplifies the submission process and ensures that everyone has
            access to standardized forms for efficient communication.

          <h3>Continuous Token Burn Mechanism</h3>
          <p>
            Through profits from rental properties, the organization
            buys REAL tokens from the open market and burns them, reducing supply and supporting token
            value. This feature not only increases the exclusivity of the platform but also adds a uniquelong-term value
            proposition for all token holders.
