        <p>
          Members can view rental property records and financials, allowing
          them to track the real-world properties generating revenue for the platform. This level of
          transparency builds trust and provides insight into property performance.

        <h3>Document and Template Access</h3>

          The platform provides members with a library of document
          templates, making it easier for users to submit property information, propose ideas, and stay

        <div class="icon-wrapper"> <i class="fas fa-fire-alt"></i> </div>
        <h3>Continuous Token Burn Mechanism</h3>
        <p>
          Through profits from rental properties, the organization
          buys REAL tokens from the open market and burns them, reducing supply and supporting token
          value. This feature not only increases the exclusivity of the platform but also adds a uniquelong-term value
          proposition for all token holders.
