        <h2 class="sub-heading text-center mt-5 mb-3">Token Supply and Distribution</h2>
        <div class="card-wrapper mb-4">
            <div class="card">
                <div class="icon-wrapper"> <i class="fas fa-lock"></i> </div>
                <h3>Maximum Token Supply</h3>
                <p>
                    REAL has a fixed maximum supply of 100 million tokens, meaning no additional tokens will ever be created. This limited supply reinforces token exclusivity over time.
                </p>
            </div>

                <h3>Token Allocation</h3>
                <p>
                    The distribution of tokens ensures support for project goals, community engagement, and platform growth:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Founders and Team: </strong> 4% tokens are allocated to core contributors to ensure long-term project development.</li>
                    <li><strong>Start-Up and Development: </strong> 2% tokens support platform technology and growth efforts.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Liquidity Pool Burn: </strong> 2% tokens will be added to Liquidity Pool and LP tokens will be burned ensuring security and confidence from our community.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Community Engagement:</strong> 92% tokens are allocated for phases of property acquisition, expanding opportunities as the REAL platform grows.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

        <h2 class="sub-heading text-center mt-5 mb-3">How the Deflationary Model Works</h2>
        <p class="sub-paragraph mx-auto mb-5">
            The REAL token’s deflationary model is designed to make membership increasingly exclusive as the token supply is reduced over time. Here’s how the model works:
        </p>
        <div class="card-wrapper mb-4">
            <div class="card card3">
                <div class="icon-wrapper"> <i class="fas fa-eye"></i> </div>
                <h3>Rental Income and Token Buybacks</h3>
                <p>
                    All rental profits generated by REAL properties are used to buy REAL tokens from the open market.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card card3">
                <div class="icon-wrapper"> <i class="fas fa-building"></i> </div>
                <h3>Token Burn Process:</h3>
                <p>
                    Once purchased, these tokens are permanently removed or “burned,” which reduces the total circulating supply.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card card3">
                <div class="icon-wrapper"> <i class="fas fa-vote-yea"></i> </div>
                <h3>Increased Exclusivity</h3>
                <p>
                    With each token burn, the remaining tokens become more exclusive, as each token represents a larger portion of the platform’s resources and benefits.This approach not only supports long-term engagement but also ensures that token holders benefit from
                    ongoing demand and scarcity.
                </p>
            </div>

        <h2 class="sub-heading text-center mt-5 mb-3">REAL’s Passive Income Strategy</h2>
        <p class="sub-paragraph mx-auto mb-5">
            Our platform generates passive income through rental properties, which is then reinvested to benefit the entire community. Here’s a breakdown:
        </p>
        <div class="card-wrapper mb-4">
            <div class="card card3">
                <div class="icon-wrapper"> <i class="fas fa-eye"></i> </div>
                <h3>Sustained Income</h3>
                <p>
                    Income from rental properties is continuous, providing a steady flow of resources back to the platform.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card card3">
                <div class="icon-wrapper"> <i class="fas fa-building"></i> </div>
                <h3>Funding Token Burns</h3>
                <p>
                    This income fuels ongoing buybacks and token burns, reinforcing the deflationary model.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card card3">
                <div class="icon-wrapper"> <i class="fas fa-vote-yea"></i> </div>
                <h3>Membership Benefits</h3>
                <p>
                    As token burns continue, REAL tokens become more exclusive, enhancing the platform experience for each member.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2 class="sub-heading text-center mt-5 mb-3">Market Dynamics and Token Value</h2>
        <p class="sub-paragraph mx-auto mb-5">
            The open market ultimately determines the price of REAL tokens, but the platform’s exclusive structure provides stability and demand. Key factors impacting value include:
        </p>
        <div class="card-wrapper mb-4">
            <div class="card card3">
                <div class="icon-wrapper"> <i class="fas fa-eye"></i> </div>
                <h3>Deflationary Mechanism</h3>
                <p>
                    With each token burn, the remaining tokens increase in exclusivity, driving up demand.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card card3">
                <div class="icon-wrapper"> <i class="fas fa-building"></i> </div>
                <h3>Controlled Supply</h3>
                <p>
                    Only 100 million tokens will ever exist, creating a limited-supply environment that supports sustainable growth.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card card3">
                <div class="icon-wrapper"> <i class="fas fa-vote-yea"></i> </div>
                <h3>Growing Community</h3>
                <p>
                    The gradual increase in circulating tokens allows for a broader community while maintaining the platform’s exclusivity.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2 class="sub-heading text-center mt-5 mb-3">Transparency and Accountability</h2>
        <p class="mission-section mb-4">
            Transparency is a cornerstone of the REAL project. We commit to clear reporting on token distribution, burning events, and platform updates. Regular reports ensure that community members stay informed about REAL’s ongoing progress and future plans.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading text-center mt-5 mb-3">Sustainable Growth through Exclusivity</h2>
        <p class="mission-section mb-4">
            The REAL tokenomics model is built for sustainable growth and increased exclusivity. As the deflationary model reduces the supply, REAL tokens become progressively rarer. This approach ensures that community members benefit from a platform designed for
            long-term success and a continually enhanced membership experience.
        </p>
