    <h2>Token Supply and Distribution</h2>
    <div class="grid-layout">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <h3>Maximum Token Supply</h3>
            <p>REAL has a fixed maximum supply of 100 million tokens, creating exclusivity over time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <h3>Token Allocation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Founders and Team:</strong> 4% allocated for long-term development.</li>
                <li><strong>Start-Up:</strong> 2% for technology growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Liquidity Pool Burn:</strong> 2% burned for security.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> 92% for property acquisition.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <h3>How the Deflationary Model Works</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rental Income and Token Buybacks:</strong> Profits from REAL properties buy REAL tokens from the market.</li>
                <li><strong>Token Burn Process:</strong> Purchased tokens are permanently removed, reducing total supply.</li>
                <li><strong>Increased Exclusivity:</strong> Each token represents a larger portion of resources and benefits.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <h3>REAL’s Passive Income Strategy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sustained Income:</strong> Continuous rental property income provides steady resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Funding Token Burns:</strong> Income supports ongoing buybacks and token burns.</li>
                <li><strong>Membership Benefits:</strong> Exclusivity increases as token burns continue, enhancing user experience.</li>
            </ul>
